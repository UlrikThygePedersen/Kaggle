Description
Data Description

This dataset contains FPS measurement of video games executed on computers. Each row of the dataset describes the outcome of FPS measurement (outcome is attribute FPS) for a video game executed on a computer. A computer is characterized by the CPU and the GPU. For both the name is resolved to technical specifications (features starting with Cpu and Gpu).

The technical specification of CPU and GPU are technical specification that describe the factory state of the respective component.

The game is characterized by the name, the displayed resolution, and the quality setting that was adjusted during the measurement (features starting with Game).

From the original data, only those observations are considered which Dataset feature's value is fps-benchmark, then the column is removed.
